# 🚀 Train YOLOv8 Object Detection on a Custom Dataset
This project demonstrates how to train a YOLOv8 object detection model on a custom dataset using the **Ultralytics YOLOv8** library and **Roboflow**. It is implemented in a Colab notebook:  
📘 `Train_yolov8_object_detection_on_custom_dataset.ipynb`

## 📌 Project Overview
This notebook provides a step-by-step guide to:
1. Install the YOLOv8 library
2. Prepare a custom dataset using Roboflow (in YOLOv8 format)
3. Train a YOLOv8 model on the dataset
4. Validate the trained model and visualize metrics
5. Run inference on new images
6. (Optional) Deploy the model on Roboflow for cloud-based inference

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/)
- Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

## 📦 Installation
Install required packages inside your notebook:
```bash
!pip install ultralytics==8.0.20
!pip install roboflow

🚀 Usage
- Dataset Preparation
- Create and annotate your dataset on Roboflow.
- Export it in YOLOv8 format.
- Training
- Replace the Roboflow project link and API key in the notebook.
- Run the training cell to train the YOLOv8 model.
- Validation
- Visualize training results like precision, recall, mAP, confusion matrix, and predicted outputs.
- Inference
- Test your model on new images and visualize predictions.
- Deployment (Optional)
- Deploy the model on Roboflow for cloud-based usage and integration.

📊 Results
The training process outputs:
- Performance metrics (mAP, precision, recall)
- Confusion matrix
- Inference examples (bounding boxes on test images)
- Model weight files
